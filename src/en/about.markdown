history: |
  PUC Ultimate was founded in 2006 as a sports section of the Paris Université Club under the name PUC Ultimate. But the story actually begins in 1989 with the birth of the Invalids.

  ### 1989 - The Invalids

  In the beginning, a few players met on Wednesday evenings on the esplanade of Les Invalides and on weekends on the lawn of Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne. The team was mainly made up of expatriates of various nationalities who introduced Ultimate to the French.

  The Invalids, about twenty players, traveled France and Europe to play in emerging tournaments, but the club struggled to grow and stagnated in terms of performance.

  In 2005, the Invalids were relegated to division 2 for the first time. The conclusion was clear: other French clubs had more resources, and the level of French Ultimate was rising.

  ### 2006 - AhOuhPUC

  In 2006, the club joined the Paris Université Club. To mark the change, it took the name AhOuhPUC, referencing its new parent club and Ah Puch, the Mayan god of death…

  The club settled on the excellent synthetic field at Stade Charléty, with two then three evening training slots per week. For its first season under its new identity, the club had over 70 members.

  In 2008, the club organized the European Club Championships, EUCF 08. The event brought together more than 400 players from 12 countries for three days on seven Parisian fields. The best European teams attracted more than 1,500 people for the open and women's finals, exceptionally played on the main field of Stade Charléty.

  That same year, the club organized the first Summer Love tournament, which has become a summer highlight in the Paris region.

  In 2009, the club, with its mixed team, participated for the first time in a major international championship at the European Championships (EUCF) in London, then at the World Championships (WUCC) in Prague the following year, and at the extended European Championships (XEUCF) in Bordeaux in 2013 and Frankfurt in 2016.

  In 2017, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, a trip to South Africa was organized with former Invalids and current players. Two mixed teams participated in the Rocktober tournament in Johannesburg. The trip included a week of exploring the country from Johannesburg to Soweto, Blyde River Canyon, and Kruger Park. This moment remains unforgettable.

  ### 2021 - PUC Ultimate

  After 15 years at the top level, Ah Ouh PUC became PUC Ultimate to strengthen its ties with the Paris Université Club.
