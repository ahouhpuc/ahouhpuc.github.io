overview: |
  The PUC Ultimate season starts on September 1st and ends on August 31st. Registration is open at the start of the season during September. It is also possible to register for a half-season (from September 1st to February 28th, or from March 1st to August 31st).

  Before registering, we invite you to attend a few practices to get a feel for the club and meet the players.
why-title: Why join?
why: |
  Ultimate is a rapidly growing sport. It requires significant athletic and technical skills at a good level, but it is a non-contact sport, easy to learn. It also allows you to be part of a group and discover the joy of taking on challenges together.

  Ultimate stands out from other team sports by:

  - Mixed-gender play on the field
  - Self-refereeing, even at a high level
  - Fair play, which is evaluated at the end of each match

  Training is very well developed in France and young French players regularly shine, as in summer 2019 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26fasW7isYM">2 European championship titles</a>.
