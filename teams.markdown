### Lillipuc

Competitive women’s team whose aim is for a Top 3 finish yearly at the French Championships.

### Open 1

Competitive men’s team for which the club's best players are selected during tryouts at the start of each season. The Open 1 team has played several years in division 1, however the upcoming 2014 season sees it relegated to division 2, with player motivation stronger than ever before to re-enter division 1!

### Open 2 and 3

Whether you’re a beginner or a more experienced player, there is a team for you! Our Open 2 team had a truly fantastic 2013/2014 season seeing it climb into division 2, where they aim to stay.

### Coed 1

Competitive mixed team playing in division 1 of the French Championships. Players are selected via tryouts. The team has often competed at an international level, both at World and European Championships, notably the XEUCF in Bordeaux and EUCR in Bergamo (2013), as well as the WUCC in Prague (2010).

### Coed 2

Our club boasts enough players for a second mixed team playing in division 2.
