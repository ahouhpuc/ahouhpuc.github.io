The first tournamanet organized by Ah Ouh Puc is coming. And it will be hard to get the victory, because we chose a unusual game format in France.
We’re setting up a Savage Seven format: teams will be made up of 9 players, with only 2 substitutes per half of 20 minutes. Find the perfect balance between performance and recovery to reach the Seventh Heaven.
