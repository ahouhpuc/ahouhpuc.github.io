# PUC Ultimate

Website of PUC Ultimate (ultimate frisbee club), previously named Ah Ouh Puc

[Visit website](https://puc-ultimate.fr/)

## Development

**NOTE**: Everything related to go is probably not in use and could be deleted from the repository. It was used when the website was hosted on a dedicated server. Now that we use only Jekyll on Github Pages, it is deprecated.

You need a recent version of ruby and go installed.

```
git clone git@github.com:ahouhpuc/ahouhpuc.github.io.git
cd ahouhpuc.github.io
bundle install
jekyll serve
```

And visit http://localhost:4000/fr.html to see your changes

## Deployment

Any update on the `master` branch triggers a new build and deployment of the website.
